# The Mathematics and Optimization of OSRS Combat

The purpose of this project is to accurately model [Old School Runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/) mechanics in order to optimize or analyze game play. This game is played over long periods of time (months or years) and so players are often seeking the most optimal route to their desired accomplishments. In particular, many attempts have been made to model combat, but certain details and high level treatment are often avoided. In addition to this, the tools that have been built by the community, focus on ease of access, which limits their ability to solve more complex tasks. An common example of this, is letting players compare two sets of gear, but being able to determine optimal setups. This project aims to solve this by using a relatively high level mathematical description coupled with a clear and easy to use codebase.

Additionally, coherent and comprehensive documentation doesn't really exist regarding the math behind osrs. This project provides a [document](https://github.com/Palfore/OSRS-Combat/blob/master/Documentation/main.pdf) (`Documentaion/main.pdf`) that attempts to fill this gap. More details on [the code](https://github.com/Palfore/OSRS-Combat/tree/master/osrsmath) can be found at `osrsmath/README.md`.
