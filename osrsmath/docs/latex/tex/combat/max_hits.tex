\chapter{Maximum Hits}
% These formula are largely given by Ref.~\cite{wiki:max_hit}. There are very many exceptions, special, and edge cases and so to verify these equations we compare them to a dataset extracted from Ref.~\cite{bitter:dps_calculator}, a well-established resource.\footnote{This is a damage calculator made in Google sheets and was created by Bitterkoekje. To extract a benchmarking dataset from this graphical resource, the python based GUI automation library, PyAutoGUI was used to acquire a random sample.} We will not consider special attacks for now.




\section{Melee}
	\begin{align}
		m_0 = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} + \frac{64 + E_\text{strength}}{640}\left\lfloor\left\lfloor\bar{L}_\text{strength} B_\text{prayer} + B_\text{stance}\right\rfloor B_\text{void melee}\right\rfloor\right\rfloor
	\end{align}

	\begin{align}
		m &= (B_2(B_1(B_\text{slayer}B_\text{salve} m_0))) \\
		B_1 &\in \{\text{arclight, LBB, DHC, DHL, C/V, TB}\} \\
		B_2 &\in \{\text{obsidian, crystal, inquisitor}\} \\
	\end{align}

	% The skill level associated with the maximum melee hit is the \texttt{strength} level. The player may boost their \texttt{strength} level with some temporary boosts, like potions. This defines a current and base level, given by $\bar L_\text{strength}$ and $L_\text{strength}$, respectively. A player may also make use of \texttt{prayers} to boost their skills. The player's attack style will also influence this.
	% The maximum melee hit is given by:
	% \begin{align}
	% 	m &= \left \lfloor c_0 + c_1 L^\text{eff}_{s} + c_2 S_w + c_3 L^\text{eff}_{s} S_w \right \rfloor\\
	% 	 L^\text{eff}_{s} &\equiv \left \lfloor (L_s + B_\text{potion})B_\text{prayer}B_\text{other} + \mathcal{S} \right \rfloor\\
	% 	 \{c_i\} &= \left \{1.3, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{80}, \frac{1}{640} \right \}.
	% \end{align}
	% For melee,
	% \begin{align}
	% 	\mathcal{S} = \begin{cases}
	% 		3 & \text{if style is \texttt{aggressive}} \\
	% 		1 & \text{if style is \texttt{controlled}}\\
	% 		0 & \text{Otherwise}
	% 	\end{cases}.
	% \end{align}
	% A list of $B_\text{potion}$, $B_\text{prayer}$, and (incomplete) $B_\text{other}$ can be found in Ref.~\cite{wiki:max_melee}.


\section{Ranged}
	The maximum ranged hit is given by:
	\begin{align}
		m &= \left \lfloor c_0 + c_1 L^\text{eff}_{r} + c_2 S_r + c_3 L^\text{eff}_{r} S_r \right \rfloor\\
		 L^\text{eff}_{s} &\equiv \left \lfloor (L_r + B_\text{potion})B_\text{prayer}B_\text{other} + \mathcal{S} \right \rfloor\\
		 \{c_i\} &= \left \{1.3, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{80}, \frac{1}{640} \right \}.
	\end{align}
	For ranged,
	\begin{align}
		\mathcal{S} = \begin{cases}
			3 & \text{if style is \texttt{accurate}} \\
			0 & \text{Otherwise}
		\end{cases}.
	\end{align}
	Note that if the attack style is set to rapid, the weapon attack speed is increased by 1 tick.
	A list of $B_\text{potion}$, $B_\text{prayer}$, and (incomplete) $B_\text{other}$ can be found in Ref.~\cite{wiki:max_ranged}.

\section{Magic}
	Magic differs slightly, so we need a few additional definitions.
	First we define $m_\text{spell}$ as the base max hit of the player's spell/staff. Some of these depend on the player's magic level. A list of these can be found in Ref.~\cite{wiki:max_magic}.
	Then there are several special items, listed below as an associated bonus $B_\text{other}$ and either an additive toggle $\bar \delta_\text{item}$ which is 1 or 0 based on the accompanying condition or a multiplicative toggle $\delta_\text{item}$ which is either $B_\text{other}^\text{item}$ or 1 based on the accompanying condition.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $B_\text{other}^\text{chaos}=3, \bar\delta_\text{chaos}$ if a \texttt{bolt} spell is used along with \texttt{Chaos gauntlets}.
		\item $B_\text{other}^\text{tome}=1.5, \delta_\text{tome}$ if a \texttt{fire} spell is used along with a \texttt{Tome of fire}.
		\item $B_\text{other}^\text{castlewars}=1.2, \delta_\text{castlewars}$ if a \texttt{Castle wars bracelet} is worn while attacking a \texttt{flag bearer}.
		\item $B_\text{other}^\text{salve}=\textit{varies}, \delta_\text{salve}$ if any variant of the \texttt{salve amulet} is worn while attacking an \texttt{undead}.
		\item $B_\text{other}^\text{slayer}=1.15, \delta_\text{slayer}$ if any variant of the \texttt{imbued black mask} is worn while attacking \texttt{slayer task monster}.
	\end{enumerate}

	Then the maximum magic hit is given by:
	\begin{align}
		m &= \left \lfloor\left \lfloor\left \lfloor\left \lfloor (m_\text{spell} + B_\text{other}^\text{chaos}\bar\delta_\text{chaos}) * (1 + S_m) \right \rfloor \delta_\text{salve}\bar\delta_\text{salve} + (1 - \bar\delta_\text{salve})\delta_\text{slayer}\right \rfloor \delta_\text{tome}\right \rfloor \delta_\text{castlewars}\right \rfloor
	\end{align}
	% A list of $B_\text{potion}$, $B_\text{prayer}$, and (incomplete) $B_\text{other}$ can be found in Ref.~\cite{wiki:max_ranged}.
